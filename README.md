# Enchantments Reloaded
## New Blocks
### Cursebreaker
Removes all curses from an item at the cost of a configurable amount (default 1/3) of that item's durability per curse
 and one nether star.
### Enchantment Crafting Table
Place and enchanted item and one of the four modifier items into the table and the modifier will imbue the enchanted
item with new properties.  
## New Items
### Randomizer
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item completely randomizes the enchantments
on the item. This will apply a random number of enchantments that could roll on that item, and each of those that have 
more than one level will have a random level.
### Enchanter
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item adds a random enchantment from the 
pool of enchantments that could enchant that item, at a random level if that enchantment has more than one level. 
### Disenchanter
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item removes a random enchantment from that
item, except for curses.
### Leveler
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item adds one level to the level of an 
enchantment on the enchanted item that could level up. Minecraft's default enchantment level rules restrict this level
up, so an item with just Sharpness V will not be affected by this item.
