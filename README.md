# Enchantments Reloaded
## New Blocks
### Cursebreaker

Removes all curses from an item at the cost of a configurable amount (default 1/3) of that item's durability per curse
 and one nether star.
### Enchantment Crafting Table

Place an enchanted item and one of the four modifier items into the table and the modifier will imbue the enchanted
item with new properties.  
### Enchantment Transfer Table

At the cost of an end rod, move all enchantments from one item to another. The only enchantments that will be put on the
new item from the old item are enchantments that could be put on the new item naturally. This process destroys the old
item. This block behaves the same way as an anvil: it's affected by physics, and it will break over time with repeated 
usage.
## New Items
### Randomizer
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item completely randomizes the enchantments
on the item. This will apply a random number of enchantments that could roll on that item, and each of those that have 
more than one level will have a random level.
### Enchanter
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item adds a random enchantment from the 
pool of enchantments that could enchant that item, at a random level if that enchantment has more than one level. 
### Disenchanter
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item removes a random enchantment from that
item, except for curses.
### Leveler
When combined with an enchanted item in the enchantment crafting table, this item adds one level to the level of an 
enchantment on the enchanted item that could level up. Minecraft's default enchantment level rules restrict this level
up, so an item with just Sharpness V will not be affected by this item.
